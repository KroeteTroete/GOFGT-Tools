# GOFGT-Tools
This repository inhabits most of the tools i used to make the Galaxy On Fire Google Translate Mod.
None of these files where made for publishing. I intended to post my working directory, so other modders
can take a look at the methods I used. I then decided to only post the scripts and spreadsheets and not any generated or vanilla sound files.

However, I'm thinking about turning a few scripts into fully fledged, publishable tools.
